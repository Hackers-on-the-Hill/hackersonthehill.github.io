                  Hackers on the Hill is run by the all-volunteer <a href="https://iamthecavalry.org" target="_blank">I Am The Cavalry</a> initiative - a group of dedicated individuals from the cybersecurity researcher community. Our goal with this event is to provide you with key resources for cybersecurity knowledge, broker connections to the wide-ranging expertise of the cybersecurity research community, and improve understanding among policymakers and the technical community.

                  An excellent question! We're still working out the details, and we intend to have a schedule posted here soon. In the meantime, please register for the event to receive updates as they become available.

                  Happy hour? Us? ;) Yes, we're planning something similar to the happy hour we had in prior years. We'll post details here and send an email update to those who have registered as they become available.

                  Oh we hope so! In 2023, the White House invited a select number of hackers for an afternoon session to discuss several cybersecurity topics (and published an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/oncd/briefing-room/2023/01/19/readout-of-office-of-the-national-cyber-director-meetings-with-cybersecurity-researchers/" target="_blank">official White House Readout on collaborating with cybersecurity researchers</a>!). We're hoping to repeat the trip again this year, though bear in mind that due to the very limited nature of the event (and the security precautions), this is an invite-only session.

                  That's a great question, and unfortunately we don't have a great answer. Parking near the Capitol tends to be extremely limited, and available spots can be a bit of a hike. Make sure to scope it out before you get on the road.

                  Thanks for checking first! Everybody loves photos. Except when they don't. And some of them won't. So ask first and try to avoid crowd shots. As far as blogging (tweeting/Xing, tooting, skeeting, whatever), we will announce the ground rules at the event - the plenary is likely to be on the record, the briefings are off the record.
