    <p>Hackers on the Hill is a semi-regular discussion program at the US Capitol with hackers from the security research community and cyber policy staffers. Run by <u><a href="https://iatc.me">I Am The Cavalry</a></u>, the program has been bridging the gap between the hacker and public policy communities since 2017, and are excited to bring the program back for the fifth time in March 2022.</p>

    <p>The event begins with briefings for the hackers on the policymaking process and current events. Afterwards, our industry-leading Ambassadors lead groups of hackers to brief House and Senate Congressional Staffers on a variety of topics, and the event concludes with a Happy Hour nearby.</p>
    <p>Do you have what it takes to cyber all the cybers? <a style="color: #FFC000;">Sign up below via our interest form by March 1</a>!</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 20px; color: #FFC000; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;">Hosting a Safe Event</h4>
<p>I Am The Cavalry is committed to keeping hackers and staffers safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. We require participants to be fully vaccinated and wear masks throughout the event.</p>
<p>The planning team is currently determining the best format for the event. We are planning for an in-person event, but may decide to hold the program virtually this year as circumstances evolve.</p>
