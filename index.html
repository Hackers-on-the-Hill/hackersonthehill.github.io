    <p>Hackers on the Hill is a semi-regular US Capitol tour with irregulars from the security research community. Bridging the gap between the hacker and public policy communities, since 2017.</p>
    <p>For the fourth time, <u><a href="https://iatc.me">I Am The Cavalry</a></u> is arranging a visit to the US Capitol for members of the security research community. Join us for interactive sessions with our live, tame Congressional staffers.</p>
    <p>The event starts with briefings at the <u><a href="https://www.aoc.gov/capitol-buildings/cannon-house-office-building">Cannon House Office Building</a></u>. We then split into groups and go to the House and Senate to brief Congressional Staffers on a variety of topics. We conclude with a Happy Hour nearby.</p>
    <p>Do you have what it takes to cyber all the cybers? Space is limited and pre-registration is required. Arrive a little early for airport-style security screening. Due to tour rules, we will have to start as a group so be prompt - stragglers will be fed to the lobbyists!</p>
    <p>Want to speak to the elected representative's office that represents you and your neighbors? Let us know who from the <a href="https://www.senate.gov/senators/index.htm">Senate</a> and <a href="https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative">House</a> represents you, and we will try to match you up with their office on the tour.</p>
