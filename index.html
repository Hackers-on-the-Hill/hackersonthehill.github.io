    <p>Hackers on the Hill is a semi-regular US Capitol tour with irregulars from the security research community. Bridging the gap between the hacker and public policy communities, since 2017.</p>
    <p>Hackers on the Hill 2020 is now over. We had around 70 hackers meet with 13 personal and committee offices, on January 30, 2020. For the fourth time, <u><a href="https://iatc.me">I Am The Cavalry</a></u> arranged a visit to the US Capitol for members of the security research community.</p>
    <p>The event began with briefings for the hackers, then our guides led groups to brief House and Senate Congressional Staffers on a variety of topics, and concluded with a Happy Hour nearby.</p>
